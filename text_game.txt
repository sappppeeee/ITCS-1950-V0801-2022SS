                    A text based game description:
My text-based game is about defeating an RPG boss by solving math problems.
The program will randomly pick a boss for you (from Black Dragon, Hell Hound,
and The White Witch). First, you will enter your name into the program. Then,
you will input the difficulty level to determine the difficulty of the math
problems(From Easy =+,- / Medium = +,-,* / Hard = +,-,*, %). Then you will have
to choose Class or Character. But Class of Character comes with a special ability
and turn limits. However, you only have to get three right answers(Unless you
choose the Warrior Class or Character for which you only need two right answers).

                      Class/Character description :

Warrior   -  The most physically strong and agile of all the other classes.
Assassin  - Unlike the Warrior or Berserker class, the Assassin class is 
            the polar opposite when come to raw strength and durability. But
            Assassin class has its advantages when it comes to agility and 
            intelligence. And can assassinate anything but the dragon.
Mage      - The "glass cannon" class, and has the ability to "one-shot" 
            anything. The class has less endurance and strength than any 
            other class.
Berserker - The berserker class is the strongest and the slowest with high
             defense. When it goes Berserk it can "one-shot" anything.
